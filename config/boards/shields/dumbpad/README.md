# Dumbpad

The [dumbpad](https://github.com/imchipwood/dumbpad) is a 4x4 macropad with one or two optional rotary encoders.

This shield includes optional support for an oled, as added in the [CustomKBD](https://customkbd.com/collections/complete-kits/products/dumbpad-4x4-macro-pad-with-rotary-encoder-support) version.

Two keymaps are included:

- dumbpad (default - oled/mcu oriented vertically on the left)
- dumbpad_oled_top (oled/mcu oriented horizontally at the top)
